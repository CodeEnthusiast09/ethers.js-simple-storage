# Ethers Simple Storage FCC

Best practices and security concerns for the provided smart contract source code:

1. Use of SPDX-License-Identifier: It is good practice to include SPDX License Identifier in the source code to specify the license under which the smart contract is deployed.

2. State Variables: Make state variables private by default and only provide public getter functions for accessing their values to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. In this contract, the `favoriteNumber` and `people` variables could be made private to restrict access.

3. Structs: When defining structs like the `People` struct, consider adding access control to prevent unauthorized modifications. You can use access control modifiers like onlyOwner to restrict access to certain functions.

4. Mapping: The `mapping` variable `nameToFavoriteNumber` could be prone to storage manipulation attacks. Consider adding access control and validation checks before updating the mapping.

5. Input Validation: Ensure proper input validation is performed in functions that interact with user input. For example, validate the length of the input string `_name` to prevent potential overflow or out-of-bounds issues.

6. Gas Limit handling: Since adding elements to the `people` array can potentially increase gas cost if there are a large number of entries, consider implementing gas limit handling techniques or pagination to prevent out-of-gas errors.

7. Event Emitting: Consider emitting events in critical functions to provide transparency and allow external parties to track contract interactions.

8. Testing: Thoroughly test the smart contract using a comprehensive test suite to identify and fix any vulnerabilities or issues before deploying it to the blockchain.

Overall, while the provided smart contract is simple, there are areas that can be improved to enhance security and efficiency. By following best practices and ensuring proper validation and access control, the contract can be made more robust and secure.
